# ISL-Player-Stats
The Indian Soccer League is a young league. With a population of about 1.2 Billion people, Indian tallent in football cannot be overlooked. This project aimes to analyse players from the ISL for seasons 2018 and 2019. The data is extracted from a CSV files that is scraped from the ISL's official website. The project shows the number of minutes each player has played. We also classify the players into 3 catergories: Defenders, Midfielders and Forwards. Further, we calculated the Per90 stat for each player in each position and plotted these statistics on a Polar graph to help understand the weaknesses and strengths of different players in different positions. I also compared each forward with Sunil Chettri's who is the leagues top performer in every statistic to analyze who can be his rival or the next player to reach his level. From looking at the graphs, possible future rivals could be Rahim Ali and Ishan Pandita.
